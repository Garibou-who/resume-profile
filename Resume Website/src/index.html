        <h2>Sales Leader | Revenue Growth, Market Expansion, Strategic Account Development</h2>
  <h3>Performance isn’t accidental. It’s engineered.</h3>

<p>👋 I’m a sales leader who translates strategy into measurable growth across complex, multi-stakeholder environments.

I’ve launched greenfield markets from zero presence, delivered 33% growth within nine months, and achieved 175% of monthly target during peak performance periods through disciplined market segmentation, operational alignment, and structured execution.

I’ve expanded enterprise partnerships across multi-site systems including Cedars-Sinai, Huntington Hospital, and Wellstar Health System, partnering with executive stakeholders to strengthen contractual relationships and support scalable growth.

I lead teams while staying close to execution, installing KPI-driven discipline, strengthening forecast governance, and elevating accountability across the revenue cycle.

  I build durable revenue engines designed to scale.</P>
