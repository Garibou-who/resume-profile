<p>👋 I’m a sales leader who translates strategy into measurable growth across complex, multi-stakeholder environments.
I’ve launched greenfield markets from zero presence, delivered 33% growth within nine months, and achieved 175% of monthly target during peak performance periods through disciplined market segmentation, operational alignment, and structured execution.I’ve expanded enterprise partnerships across multi-site systems including Cedars-Sinai, Huntington Hospital, and Wellstar Health System, partnering with executive stakeholders to strengthen contractual relationships and support scalable growth. I lead teams while staying close to execution, installing KPI-driven discipline, strengthening forecast governance, and elevating accountability across the revenue cycle. I build durable revenue engines designed to scale.</p>
